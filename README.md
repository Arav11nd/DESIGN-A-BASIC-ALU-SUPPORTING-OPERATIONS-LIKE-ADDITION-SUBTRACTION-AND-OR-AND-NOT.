# Basic ALU Design with Modelsim Simulation

This repository showcases the design and simulation of a fundamental Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), implemented using Verilog Hardware Description Language and simulated within the Modelsim environment. The ALU is designed to perform a set of essential arithmetic and logical operations, serving as a building block for more complex digital systems. Specifically, it supports addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, bitwise OR, and bitwise NOT operations.

## Project Overview

The ALU is a crucial component in any central processing unit (CPU), responsible for executing arithmetic and logical instructions. This project aims to provide a clear and concise implementation of a basic ALU, allowing users to understand the underlying principles of digital logic design and simulation. The design is implemented in a modular fashion, making it easy to comprehend and modify. The simulation testbench validates the functionality of the ALU across a range of input combinations, ensuring its correctness and reliability.

## Project Structure and File Descriptions

* `alu.v`: This Verilog file contains the core implementation of the ALU. It defines the inputs, outputs, and internal logic of the ALU, including the combinational logic for each supported operation. The design utilizes a `case` statement to select the appropriate operation based on the `select` input.
* `alu_tb.v`: This Verilog testbench file is used to simulate the `alu.v` module. It generates a series of test vectors, applies them to the ALU inputs, and compares the ALU outputs with the expected results. The testbench provides comprehensive coverage of all supported operations, ensuring the ALU's functionality is thoroughly validated.
* **Note:** Both `alu.v` and `alu_tb.v` are located in the same directory for ease of access and project management.
* `README.md`: This file serves as the project documentation, providing an overview of the project, implementation details, simulation instructions, and other relevant information.
* `Modelsim_Project/`: (Optional) This directory may contain Modelsim project files, including waveform configuration files and project settings, which facilitate the simulation process.

## Implementation Details and Design Choices

The ALU is designed using combinational logic, meaning that the output is solely determined by the current input values. This approach simplifies the design and ensures that the ALU operates efficiently. The `select` input, a multi-bit signal, is used to choose the desired operation. A `case` statement within the Verilog code maps each `select` value to a specific operation.

* **Addition and Subtraction:** These operations are implemented using the `+` and `-` operators in Verilog, respectively. The ALU performs standard binary addition and subtraction.
* **Bitwise AND, OR, and NOT:** These logical operations are implemented using the `&`, `|`, and `~` operators in Verilog, respectively. These operators perform bitwise logical operations on the input operands.

The input and output ports are defined as follows:

* `A`: Input operand A, representing the first input to the ALU.
* `B`: Input operand B, representing the second input for addition, subtraction, AND, and OR operations.
* `select`: Operation select signal, determining which operation the ALU performs.
* `result`: Output result of the ALU operation.

## Simulation and Verification

The simulation is performed using Modelsim, a widely used HDL simulation tool. The `alu_tb.v` testbench provides a set of test cases designed to exercise all supported operations. The testbench applies different combinations of input values and `select` signals, and then compares the ALU's output with the expected results. The waveform viewer in Modelsim allows users to visually inspect the simulation results and verify the ALU's functionality.

### Tools and Resources

* **Modelsim and Xilinx:** Used for Verilog simulation and waveform analysis.
* **YouTube:** Served as a valuable resource for learning Verilog syntax, simulation techniques, and ALU design principles.
* **Gemini AI:** Assisted in debugging the Verilog code, identifying potential errors, and improving the overall quality of the design.
